# Word Translator

> A simple translator application that takes a word (or even a few words) and translates them to the language of choice.

Currently only `4` languages are available. 
More will be added in the future. Till then, hope you have fun trying this out :)

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
